The repository contains the data file of Modeling pH variability in an idealized estuary.

The files are compressed and split due to the size limit of single file in the repository (25 M). The data are archived by the scenario. The model runs include the baseline, changing atmospheric forcing (a1-a5), changing oceanic input (o1-o5), changing nutriet loading (l0.25-l2.00), and turning off biological processes (nobio). Please see the manuscript for details of these model runs.

When obtaining the data files, please first unzip them. The name of each data file consists of variable name and time. For example, ALK0200 means the alkalinity data on day 200 of the 10-year run. Variables include total suspended solids (TSS), phytoplankton (GA), zooplankton (SZ), ammonium (NH4), nitrite and nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and alkalinity (ALK).
